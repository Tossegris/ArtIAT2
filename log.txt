- Created "HOW-TO-program-stiat.txt" file with steps on creating custom ST-IAT using iatgen:writeSCIATfull()
- Created first version of my custom ST-IAT 
- Exported to .qsf

- Moved practice blocks to a new survey; and added logic; so that works
- Now I need to fix the instructions/slide numbering on the slides in such a way that it all makes sense with the practice blocks in there.
	- e.g., "1 of 4" and "...just like the last task"

- I'm going to try and run an entire test IAT from scratch; then my plan is to:
	(1) Look at the data to see how easily interpretable it is; I don't anticipate much/any problem here;
	(2) See if I can eventually "steal" a single IAT block AS PRACTICE and place it into a new (i.e., the real) ST-IAT survey
		- This may be harder.
