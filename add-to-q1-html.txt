<p>Attention! A <b>third</b> category has been added above, but the rules remain the same. Remember, each word/image fits in only one of the three categories. The label/item colors may help you identify the appropriate category.
<br>
<br>
Use the <span style="font-weight: bold">E</span> key for the category/categories on the left and the <span style="font-weight: bold">I</span> key for the category/categories on the right. Again, try to go as fast as possible without making mistakes. Correct errors by hitting the other key. Practice this combination now.

When you are ready, please press the [Space] bar to begin.
