# iatgen-stiat
Developing a single-target implicit association test (ST-IAT; based on 'iatgen' software developed by Carpenter et al. [under review]) for use with Qualtrics survey platform

Initial code for develping ST-IAT obtained from [Dr. Tom Carpenter](http://spu.edu/academics/school-of-psychology-family-community/faculty-and-staff/thomas-carpenter-profile), one of the lead developers of [iatgen](https://iatgen.wordpress.com/), which enables researchers to implement IAT's on Qualtrics.
